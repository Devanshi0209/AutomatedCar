# AutomatedCar

Statistical data shows that 94% of the accidents occurring are due to manual error in driving and it increases everyday. To prevent this, the market is in need of automated self-driving cars with the promise of reduced devastation of impaired driving, drugged driving, unbelted vehicle occupants, speeding and distraction. They provide personal freedom to disabled people, enhance the independence for senior drivers, increase efficiency on roads and minimize crashes, fender benders and roadway blocks. In this project, I implement a fully autonomous simulated car which will be able to drive on multi-lane roads while adhering to the traffic rules and perform other tasks such as obstacle detection, altering speed etc. To implement the vision for the automated vehicle I make use of the OpenCV Computer Vision library so that the car can identify lane lines on the road. Convolutional Neural networks and Keras are used to predict steering angles for the vehicle while on the road and TensorFlow Object Detection and Transfer Learning are used to detect and classify traffic lights and signals. Finally, I make use of behavioral cloning to test our automated car in the CARLA simulated environment.
